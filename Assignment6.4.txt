#a. What are the assumptions of ANOVA, test it out?

#To use the ANOVA test we made the following assumptions:

#1) Each group sample is drawn from a normally distributed population
#2) All populations have a common variance
#3) All samples are drawn independently of each other
#4) Within each sample, the observations are sampled randomly and independently of each other
#5) Factor effects are additive
#for checking normality assumption
x <- yeastdata$nuc
h <- hist(x, breaks = 10, col = "red", xlab = "Score of discriminant analysis of nuclear localization signals
          of nuclear and non-nuclear proteins", main = "Histogram of Score with normal curve")
xfit <- seq(min(x), max(x), length= 40)
yfit <- dnorm(xfit, mean = mean(x), sd = sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2]* length(x))
lines(xfit, yfit , col = "blue", lwd = 2)
#for checking skewness or kurtosis and variances 
library(psych)
describe(yeastdata)
#for checking outliers
boxplot(yeastdata)



#b. Why ANOVA test? Is there any other way to answer the above question?

#ANOVA allows researcher to evaluate all the mean differences in a single hypothesis test 
#using a single ??-level and thereby keep the risk of a Type I error under control, 
#no matter how many different means are being compared.
#A regression analysis will accomplish the same goal as an ANOVA.


#The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) is used to determine whether there are any statistically significant 
#differences between the means of three or more independent (unrelated) groups

#The one-way ANOVA compares the means between the groups you are interested in and determines whether 
#any of those means are statistically significantly different from each other

#In the situation where there multiple response variables you can test them simultaneously using a 
#multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)

#As in salescity dataset we see that our categorical variables has more than 2 levels hence we are using 
#anova t test ,otherwise if our independent variables that is city here in salescity dataset
#has got only 2 levels than we used "independent sample t test

#Thus we can use independent sample t test also if our independent variables has got only 2 levels

#the other ways for testing which we can used are by plotting 
#histogram
#scatterplot
#box plot
#qq plot

#by this too
#Levene's test
#Fligner Killeen test
#Bartlett's tes
