1. Import the Titanic Dataset from the link Titanic Data Set.
Perform the following:
a. Is there any difference in fares by different class of tickets?
Note - Show a boxplot displaying the distribution of fares by class

Solution: Yes, as box plot shows class 1 having higher fare than class 2 and 3, and class 2 is having higher fare than class 1

pclass <- titanic_data$pclass
fare <- titanic_data$fare

ggplot(titanic_data,aes(pclass, fare))+
  geom_boxplot(width=0.5,fill="firebrick",colour="cadetblue2",outlier.color = "purple",outlier.shape = 2)+
  ggtitle("Distribution of fares by class")

b. Is there any association with Passenger class and gender?
Note – Show a stacked bar chart

Solution: 

There is a clear interaction effect between Passenger Class and Sex. First and second class female passengers had a higher mean number of survivors than the third class female passengers. 
First class male passengers had a higher mean number of survivors than the second and third class male passengers.

pclass <- titanic_data$pclass
sex <- titanic_data$sex

ggplot(titanic_data,aes(pclass,fill=sex))+
  geom_bar()+
  xlab("Passenger class")+
  ylab("Count of survivor")+
  ggtitle("Association with passenger class and sex")
